# Lab7-Collections
## Deck of cards 
This collection builds a deck of 12 cards. It demonstrates the use of collections through IEnumerables and enums to show and output the information from my classes to the console.

## Interactions and usage

The application starts of creating a new deck using the Deck class. It then creates cards from the card class. Using the method Add(card), we have the ability to populate a new deck and add cards. Using the Remove card method that comes from the deck class will be able to select an individual card and remove it.


## Testing 

Tests comnfirm you can add a card, remove a card and that you are unable to add a card if it does not exist.
